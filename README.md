# SpringBootWithHazelcast

Getting Started

	Added dependency

	spring-boot-starter-cache

	To use caching in your Spring Boot application, you need to:

	1. add org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-cache dependency
	2. add @EnableCaching annotation to your main class
	3. add @Cacheable("books") annotation to every method you want to cache

	Run SpringBootWithHazelcastApplication.java 

	You can test the application by opening this url from the browser.

	http://localhost:9090/examples/1234

	The first time you execute this command it should take some time to get the response. However, when you try it again, itâ€™s instant. That means that the cache is used.


	Run Spring boot in different  port 

	Run this command in your cmd  :- java -jar -Dserver.port=9000 SpringBootWithHazelcast-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
